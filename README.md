# Web Sources Rating

## Overview

A skeleton for a simple one-page [Meteor.js](https://www.meteor.com/) app for collecting and rating web sites.

## Features
- initially, 4 sources are displayed
- all users can vote up or down displayed sources; the sources are dynamically arranged according to the rating (the highest rated are on the top)
- users can register and login/out
- registered users can add new sources (title, URL, description), which by default gets 0 rating
- on clicking "Learn more" button details page is rendered where user can also vote pro/contra; results are preserved
- on page reload and even project restart, the list of sources and number of votes are preserved (it is needed to manually clean up a database to restart app from scratch).
